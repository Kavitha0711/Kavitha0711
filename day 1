why index is start from zero ?

      * In python we have indexing.
      * Index is always start from zero.
             Reason:
                 *index is start from 0 because it
                 allows forefficient memory management.
                 * index is used as an offset.

     ex:- x=[]1,2,3,4,5]
          print(x[0])
          print(x[1])
          print(x[2])
          print(x[3])

print() function :
     
   -> In python,print() is built-in function,meaning it can be used without importing any modules
    -> It outputs the specified text or variable value that is written in inside the parenthesis
   ex:- 1) a=12
           print(a)
        2)print("goutham")

return() 
   
  ->In python return is a FUNCTION.
  ->It is used to returnthe statement,variable,value etc
  ->It terminates the execution of function 
       and returns a value 
    ex:-def greet():
            return "hello"
        print(greet())
